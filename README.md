# DreamTeamSeniorDesign
A place to maintain files for our senior design project.

## Important notes
- DON'T DIRECTLY EDIT THE `master` OR `dev` BRANCH.  Make your own branch (`git checkout -b <branchName>`), do all of your devlopment on that branch, and when you have a stable, well-documented build, then open a pull request to merge it with `dev`.
